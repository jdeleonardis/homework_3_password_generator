Homework 3

# Description
This is my submitted work for Homework 3 - Password Generator.  The assignment was to create javascript that would generate a random password from 8 to 128 characters, using upper, lower, numeric, and special characters, based on user inputs.

The site needed to
* Prompt the user how many characters in the password (must be between 8 and 128)
* Prompt the user to select if they want upper, lower, numeric, or special characters in the password.  The user must select at least
one type of character.
* Return the generated password to the screen.

# Validation
Javascript was validated with a series of console log commands which remain in the js file (but commented out).
